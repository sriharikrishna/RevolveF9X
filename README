This is a Fortran9X adaptation of the functionality of "Revolve", see:

 Reverse or Adjoint Mode of Computational Differentiation"
Article in ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 2000  

The interface of the routines differs from the cited revolve implementation 
found in Adol-C and has been designed to be more in line with the 
Fortran 9X language features.

The code is contained in revolve.f90, the use is illustrated in 
example.f90, both written by J. Utke.
